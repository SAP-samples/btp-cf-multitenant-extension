# Explore APIs & events in SAP API Business Hub

The SAP API Business Hub is a web application hosted by SAP to discover, explore, and test SAP and partner APIs (application programming interfaces) that are required to build extensions or process integrations.

Go through the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/) and check whether these APIs can help you complete your extension scenario. 

Then, go to the *Details* section of the APIs you have chosen and check for communications scenarios these APIs belong to. 

You can also search through the APIs for ideas.
