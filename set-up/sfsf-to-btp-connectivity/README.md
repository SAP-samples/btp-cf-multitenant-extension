# Configure the connectivity between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP BTP

To integrate SAP BTP and SAP SuccessFactors so that you can build extension applications, you need to perform the following tasks:
1. Connect the SAP SuccessFactors system that you want to extend with the corresponding global account in SAP BTP. See [Register an SAP SuccessFactors System in a Global Account in SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/e956ba209f30447cb55140e38c15e345.html).
2. Make the SAP SuccessFactors system accessible in the subaccounts in which you want to build your extension applications. See [Configure the Entitlements for the SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/b01e6255607a42889483115dbd56cc1f.html).
3. Configure the communication flow. See [Create a Service Instance to Consume the SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite OData API](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/46c5ea17eff94bc6949857e588797273.html).
4. Configure the Single-Sign On (SSO) between the subaccount in SAP BTP and the SAP SuccessFactors system. See [Configure Single-Sign On Between a Subaccount in SAP BTP and SAP SuccessFactors](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/64da613776814c3f8d899686dee558ca.html).
5. If you have performed an automated instance refresh or your cloud operators have performed a manual instance refresh, you need to restore some of the extension configuration settings. See [Restore Configuration Settings After an Instance Refresh](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/4c1bf988d60e49bf95a488f5ec18f2b4.html).
